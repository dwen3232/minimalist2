# Minimalist 2
Inspired by https://github.com/fogleman/primitive.  I wrote this in Python originally, but it was incredibly slow.  Currently, only supports Ellipse shapes with single thread hill climbing.  I plan to refactor (code could be more idiomatic) and to improve the algorithm's speed (add multithreading capabilities, improve existing functions).

Shown below is the Mona Lisa reconstructed with 50 ellipses:
